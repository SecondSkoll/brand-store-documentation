Dedicated Snap Store Documentation
==================================

This repository contains documentation for Dedicated Snap Stores. It allows the
documentation to be templated with customer specific account details.

This set of documentation is based on the `Canonical Sphinx Docs Starter Pack <https://github.com/canonical/sphinx-docs-starter-pack>`_.
See that project for general instructions.

See ``WORKFLOW.rst`` for instructions on adding or updating a domain for a
specific Dedicated Snap Store.
