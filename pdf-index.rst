PDF Canonical Dedicated Snap Store
*************************

A Dedicated Snap Store is a dedicated, private Snap Store which facilitates the publication of private snaps and curation of public snaps for Ubuntu
Core devices associated with the Dedicated Snap Store.   

A Dedicated Snap Store permits the use of hardware / privileged snapd interfaces, and the hosting of gadget and kernel snaps, in addition to providing a
Dedicated Snap Store namespace for snap registration. It can function in offline environments, and allows full control over snaps available to
devices associated with the store.

A Dedicated Snap Store provides an optimised, private, and secure distribution mechanism for software distribution via snap packages. This includes
an extensive permission model which provides control over the confinement rules governing snaps published in the Dedicated Snap Store.

The use cases for a Dedicated Snap Store are broad, from IoT devices in the field to cloud and desktop machines. This includes IoT companies, ODMs &
OEMs, silicon vendors and others.

This documentation provides links to some key pages, and provides information on some key concepts and processes specific to your Dedicated Snap Store.
