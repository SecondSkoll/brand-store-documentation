# Getting started with IoT

Bringing IoT products to market involves varied requirements, ranging from embedded engineering, app development, backend hosting, software update infrastructure, maintenance and after-sales customer support. 
Deploying these capabilities at scale typically requires large upfront investments. The complexity involved in acquiring and orchestrating these requirements delays time-to-market.
