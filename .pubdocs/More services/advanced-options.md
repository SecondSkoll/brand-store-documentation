# Advanced options

The following advanced security, integrity and resilience options harden smart devices exposed to challenging environments. All are available as part of our IoT Professional Services packages.

## Secure boot

Ensures the integrity of both the boot mechanism and the operating system environment it bootstraps.

* Guarantees a device can only run a certified workload
* Secures a device against both physical and remote attacks
* Verifies boot binaries, and kernel, against known keys held in the device firmware

## Full disk encryption

Essential for devices with personal information in regulated industries:

* Hardware key management
* Optional key escrow
* Choice of ciphers and hardware acceleration
* Minimal performance impact
* TPM integration with the current CA (x86 only)

## FIPS certification

Allows your devices to meet Federal information processing requirements:

* FIPS-certified kernel and cryptographic libraries
* FIPS certification takes place every six months
* Fully compliant devices must restrict updates to certified versions (x86 only)

## Kernel Livepatch

Reduce the number of reboots by live patching the running kernel against critical vulnerabilities. Requires specific certified kernel and x86 architecture.

* Maximise service availability
* Fixes are applied automatically, without restarting your system
* Reduces downtime, keeping systems both secure and compliant

## High availability Kubernetes

With [Canonical MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/) and [Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes), you gain a fully CNCF conformance cloud-native Kubernetes for device application operations, including clustering for high availability, service mesh support and automatic security updates.
