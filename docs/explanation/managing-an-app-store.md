# Managing a Dedicated Snap Store

Once connected to a Dedicated Snap Store, devices access a catalog of snaps
curated by the Brand. Connected devices check for updates of these apps
regularly. The Brand determines software update policies for devices connected
to their store via [refresh control](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/core/explanation/refresh-control/).

## Curating a catalog of snaps

Snaps offered to fleets of authenticated and authorized devices can be curated
from three content sources. The first source is the snaps published by the
Brand. The second source is publicly available snaps from the Global Store. The
third source is snaps published by third-parties in other Dedicated Snap stores
that the third-party Brand has allowed to for distribution. Individual snaps can
be selected from these different sources to assemble a catalog for a particular
fleet of devices. Brands have full control over the versions of all snaps
available through their Device View stores.

## Monitoring and analytics

User engagement, adoption, retention and churn can be actively tracked from the
analytics dashboard available in each Dedicated Snap Store. Usage analytics can
be fine-grained to specific app versions and revisions. Monitoring capabilities
embedded in Dedicated Snap Stores enable detailed usage metering.
