Snap inclusion
==============

Snap inclusion and exclusion are terms used with the Dedicated Snap Store to
describe which applications can be seen by the connected devices.

For a set of devices to see snaps, the administrator must 'include' them in via
the dashboard of the Dedicated Snap Store. They can decide whether to include
public snaps from the Global Snap Store or private snaps from the Base store.
Once included within a Device View store for a specific model of devices, the
snaps will be visible to those devices. If for any reason a snap is no longer
needed on those devices, the snap can be removed from the Device View store in
the dashboard of the Dedicated Snap Store. In the case of exclusion, the snap
will still exist in either the Global Snap Store or Base store. However, it will
no longer be visible to devices.
