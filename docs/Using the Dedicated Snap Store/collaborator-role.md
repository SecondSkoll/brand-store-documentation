#  Users and roles: collaborators

A collaborator is a store user that can have equal rights over a particular snap as the snap publisher. This means that a collaborator can upload and release snap revisions. Collaborators can collectively contribute to a snap and administer its listing in the store.

While only snap publishers or collaborators can publish a snap revision, team members can collaborate on the source code of a snap that could be built straight from the codeâ€™s repository. 

In the Dedicated Snap Store or the [Snap Store](snapcraft.io), a collaborator is role specific to a particular snap. This role can not be assigned at the store level as the store administrator cannot define someone as a collaborator. 

The snap publisher can use the [snaps dashboard](https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/snaps) to manage collaborators assigned to a snap.
