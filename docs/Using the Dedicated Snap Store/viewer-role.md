# Users and roles: viewer

The viewer role in the App Store has the fewest permissions granted. Viewers can see and download snaps from their Dedicated Snap Store. Downloaded snaps can be used to build images or perform testing.
Devices connecting to the Dedicated Snap Store do not require a store account with viewer permissions. To find out more about that see connecting new devices.
