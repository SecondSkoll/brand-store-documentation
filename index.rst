Canonical Brand Store
=====================


The Brand Store is a marketplace engine for software.

It provides a platform for publishers to release and distribute software
artefacts and for consumers to discover, deploy and update them, including in
environments with limited or no network and compatibility with any
Linux-based OS or device. The Brand Store also offers the option to publish private snaps.
