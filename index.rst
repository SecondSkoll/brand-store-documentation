Canonical Brand Store
=====================


The Brand Store is a marketplace engine for software specific to a single customer.

Your Brand Store controls software distribution and delivery to any number of machines, along with automatic updates to ensure your
applications are always up-to-date. This allows you to have control over the list of snaps associated devices have access to.

Brand Stores supports a range of use cases, from IoT devices in the field to cloud and desktop machines, for IoT companies, ODMs & OEMs,
silicon vendors and others.

This documentation provides links to some key pages, and provides information on some key concepts and processes specific to your Brand Store.
For general use of the Brand Store, see the `main documentation source <https://ubuntu.com/core/services/guide/iot-app-store-intro>`_.
